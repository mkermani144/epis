# Epis Frontend

A React frontend for real-time voice chat with the Epis server.  
**This code is totally generated by AI, with the least possible human supervision.**

## Features

- Real-time voice chat using WebSocket
- Audio recording with tap-and-hold interface
- Automatic audio playback of AI responses
- Visual feedback with different circle states:
  - **Idle** (grey): Waiting for user input
  - **Recording** (red): Audio is being recorded
  - **Waiting** (pulsing grey): Processing audio
  - **Responding** (blue): Playing AI response

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure the server URL (optional):
   Create a `.env.local` file with:
   ```
   VITE_EPIS_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure the Epis server is running
2. Open the frontend in your browser
3. Allow microphone permissions when prompted
4. Tap and hold the circle to record your voice
5. Release to send the audio to the server
6. Wait for the AI response to play automatically

## Technical Details

- **Audio Format**: Records in WebM/Opus, converts to WAV format for server compatibility
- **WebSocket**: Connects to `/ws/lingoo/voice-chat` endpoint
- **REST API**: Creates conversation via `/lingoo/conversation/create`
- **State Management**: Simple React state for voice chat flow
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design

## Development

The app automatically:
- Creates a conversation on page load
- Connects to the WebSocket
- Handles audio recording and playback
- Manages voice chat states
- Provides visual feedback for all states
